> A frontend css styling framework, alternative way to style elements instead of writing css. The styles are in the classnames of the element

# Examples

```html
<!-- This element will have a minimum size of the parent -->
<div class="w-full h-full"></div>

<!-- This element will be a flex box with a gap of 6 px between elements -->
<div class="flex gap-2">...</div>
```
